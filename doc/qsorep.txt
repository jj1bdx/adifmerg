NAME
    qsorep - QSO repository with ADIF-files

SYNOPSIS
    qsorep -l repdir [-c command] [-h] [-v] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
    The qsorep can be used to add or edit QSOs in an ADIF-file repository.
    The repository directory needs to be given with the option -l. If the
    directory does not exist, a new repository is created. The repository
    has subdirectories for the ADIF logs and produced QSL cards. There are
    separate directories for the exported Cabrillo logs, csv-files, eQSL
    logs and LoTW logs. The filter subdirectory has all the filters to
    manipulate the log files. For example to *txt2adif* has a single line

    | adifmerg -f -txt -o

    meaning that text is read from the standard input and ADIF-data is
    written to standard output. It is necessary to create own custom filters
    to the filter directory.

    The configuration files for each ADIF-log is hidden into directory
    .qsorep/ .

    Production of QSL labels or QSL cards is possible. Use for example git
    to track changes in the log files.

OPTIONS
    -l directory for repository

    -c execute command string

    -h display a short help text

    *file* add

    Create a new log file. The file type 'eqsl', 'log' or 'lotw' determines
    how new QSOs and QSLs are added to the log. Optionally the file can
    created from file2.

    *file* create eqsl|log|lotw [path/file2] [filter [parameters]]

    A *filter* can be used to modify the ADIF-file and *parameters* can be
    passed to the adifmerg(1).

    Edit ADIF-log or its configuration file. With the *diff* option the
    diff(1) is used to show the difference to the original file.

    *file* edit [config|diff]

    Export ADIF-log as Cabrillo, csv, eQSL, LoTW, template filled or text
    file. The 'file2' is given as a template for the 'cab' or 'temp'
    options.

    *file* export cab|csv|eqsl|lotw|temp|txt [file2]

    Print short or verbosed info on the logfile.

    *file* info [verbosed]

    Print help on command.

    [command] help

    Print history of commands.

    [number] history

    List logfiles or print log on the screen. The QSOs can be selected with
    for example 'CALL=DX0ABC'.

    *file* list [verbosed] [selection]

    Merge file2 to file.

    *file* merge file2 [diff|test]

    Add QSLs to file.

    *file* qsl [diff]

    Add QSOs to file.

    *file* qso [diff]

    Sort logfile to ascending time order.

    *file* sort

    Split logfile into smaller logs with a set, e.g. 'bands'.

    *file* split set

    The possible sets are: bands, cont, country, cqz, dxcc, grids, grid6,
    grid8, grid10, iota, ituz, modes, props, sota and stations.

    Print qsorep(1) version.

    version

REPOSITORY DIRECTORIES
    Typical QSO repository has following directories

    *adif* All the ADIF-log files are in this directory.

    *cabrillo* Produced Cabrillo files.

    *cards* Produced QSL-card files.

    *csv* Produced CSV files.

    *eqsl* Produced eQSL ADIF-files.

    *filter* Filters to modify and export ADIF-files.

    *lotw* Produced ADIF-files for signing and uploading to LoTW.

    *txt* Produced text files.

    In addition there is a hidden *.qsorep* directory. This directory has a
    configuration file for all the ADIF-log files in *adif* directory.

    Any external temporary data can live outside of the repository for
    example in /tmp.

EXAMPLE
    Create initial local copy of LoTW QSOs

    *lotwin* create *lotw*

    Print info on the *lotwin.adi* file

    *lotwin* info *verbosed*

    Update received QSLs from LoTW

    *lotwin* qsl *diff*

    Split log file into different log files for each station call sign

    *lotwin* split *stations*

    Extrac all QSOs to NO0CALL

    *NO0CALL* create *log* Qsorep/adif/lotwin.adi dummy -S CALL=NO0CALL

    Create new log for downloaded SOTA QSOs, use filter sotaMY0CALL and
    select QSOs on date 20130331

    *20130331SOTAREF* create *log* /home/my0call/Downloads/mylog.csv
    sotaMY0CALL -S QSO_DATE=20130331

    Typical filter file sotaMY0CALL could contain a line like

    | adifmerg -f - -o -R MY_SOTA=SOTA -A
    MY_COUNTRY=Finland,MY_ITU_ZONE=18,MY_CQ_ZONE=15

    Export the file for signing and uploading to LoTW

    *20130331SOTAREF* export *lotw*

    Update QSOs

    *20130331SOTAREF* merge newlog *diff*

    Edit main log file *my0call*

    *my0call* edit *diff*

    Note that some information can be lost in editing.

    Add a QSO to the log file

    *my0call* add

    Add QSOs from received paper QSL cards by call signs and merge with the
    main log file

    *my0callqslr* create *log* Qsorep/adif/my0call.adi

    *my0callqslr* qsl *diff*

    *my0call* merge *my0callqslr*

DIAGNOSTICS
    The *qsorep* has been tested with perl v5.10.1. You may need to adapt
    the script to your environment.
